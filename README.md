# Animating Strogatz

Animating concepts from [*Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos with Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering*, Steven Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering).

I presented these at the [University of Minnesota math directed reading program](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~mahrud/drp/).
